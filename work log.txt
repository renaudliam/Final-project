2022-04-25: Modified print apod info function and moved sha256 code to download_apod_img function. Impleted a day function that calculates what day it is and uses that to get apod image.   today = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
Completed image_already_db function. Impletmented feature that checks db for a sha256 value that matches image. If theres a match the image wont download.
